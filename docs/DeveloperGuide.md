1. [AddressBook-level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/)
   <br> Inspired to design the overall program structure like AB3.
2. [AddressBook-level2](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2/blob/master/src/seedu/addressbook/parser/Parser.java)
   <br> Adapted Parser code from AddressBook (Level 2) which makes efficient use of Pattern matching to filter valid
   inputs from invalid inputs. Created our own Pattern Regex to simplify the parsing process to capture the needed matching
   groups, which also improves code readability instead of writing many lines of code to parse word by word.

   <br> JSON APIs from [json.org]((https://www.json.org/json-en.html)) were used to develop storage function.

## Setting up

This section describes some pre-requisites and instructions to set up the application on your computer. Do follow the instructions closely
as any deviations may cause unexpected outcomes or cause application to not startup.

**Pre-requisites**

1. JDK 11
2. IntelliJ IDEA IDE

**Setting up the Project in Your Computer**

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp), and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open up IntelliJ. If you are not at the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close any existing project
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
    1. Click `File` > `New Project Setup` > `Structure`, and ensure `Project SDK` is using `JDK 11`. Click `OK`
4. Import the project
    1. Click `File` > `Open Project`
    2. Select the project directory, and click `OK` to accept the default settings
5. Verify the setup: After the importing is complete, locate `CliverShelf.java` file, right-click it
   and `Run 'CliverShelf.main()'`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like this:

```

```

## Design

This section will briefly describe the overall design and structure of major components in the CLIverShelf.

### Architecture

![](diagrams/Architecture.svg)

The architecture diagram above describes the design of CLIverShelf. The main components are:

1. `CliverShelf` Responsible for initializing the various components and connecting them up with one another at app
   launch.
2. `UI`: Handles the interactions with the user.
3. `Logic`: Parses and executes the user input commands.
4. `Model`: Holds the data of the App in memory
5. `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

### General Program Flow

This section illustrates how the major components interact with each other during program run.

![](diagrams/Architecture_GeneralProgramFlowSequenceDiagram.svg)

1. User runs the programs & input user commands
2. `CliverShelf` calls `Parser` to `parseCommand()`
3. `Parser` creates and returns a `Command` object when parsed successful
4. `CliverShelf` calls the `Command` object to `execute()`, and it returns a String `result`
5. `CliverShelf` instantiates `UI` component to print the `result`


### UI component

The `UI` component is responsible for all the user inputs and system outputs. It is in charge of the display of success
command executions, error messages and also user interactions by prompting for the next command.

The class diagram below shows the associations between classes of the UI components

![](diagrams/UI_ClassDiagram.svg)

The `UI` component is made up of 2 classes:

* `MessageBubble`: Responsible for the display of messages.
* `PredefinedMessages`: Holds some predefined messages required for MessageBubble to print to console.
* `Wrapping`: Responsible for managing soft-wrapping messages and provide method to truncate message to desired length.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how message can be printed without a MessageBubble instance.

![](diagrams/UI_StaticPrintMessageSequenceDiagram.svg)

### Logic component

The `Logic` component is responsible for parsing and executing user commands. The class diagram below shows the associations between the classes that make up the `Logic` component.

![](diagrams/Logic_ClassDiagram.svg)

The `Logic` component consists of `Parser`, `Command` and `Sales` components.

1. After user enters input, `CliverShelf` creates `Parser`.
2. The input is parsed within `Parser`, generating a `Command` object, which is then executed.
3. For sales-related commands, `Sales` is also used.
4. After execution, the relevant output generated from `Command` is then generated to the user (e.g. successful command
   execution or error messages)

### Logic: Subcomponent Parser

This section will illustrate how the Parser interacts with `Clivershelf` class and different `Command` classes.

**API**: [Parser.java](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/logic/parser/Parser.java)

![](diagrams/ParserSequenceDiagram.svg)

1. When user enters a command into the terminal, upon submission, `CliverShelf` receives the input line and calls
   the `Parser` to `parseCommand()`
2. `Parser` first checks for basic command format, to extract the 1st word in the input which is the `commandWord`
3. The `commandWord` would then be checked against the respective `COMMAND_STRINGS` such as `add`, `delete` , etc.
4. If the `commandWord` matches any of the strings, the function will proceed to execute
   the `prepare{commandWord}(arguments)` function of the `Parser`
5. Lastly, when the Parsing is complete, the `Parser` will return the `{commandWord}Command` object to the `CliverShelf`
   component, for `Clivershelf` to decide what to do with the `{commandWord}Command` object.

### Logic: Subcomponent Command

**API**: [Command.java](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/logic/command/Command.java)

![](diagrams/Logic_Command_SequenceDiagram.svg)

1. `Command` is an abstract class and has an abstract method `execute()`.
2. Specific commands, such as `AddCommand` or `DeleteCommand`, are the subclasses of `Command`. Each one of them is
   responsible for one function of the application, such as adding new items or deleting items.
3. Specific commands will be instantiated inside the `parseCommand(userInputLine: String): Command` method of `Parser`
   and is then returned to the `CliverShelf` after they are instantiated.
4. The `CliverShelf` will call the `execute()` method of the `Command` object to execute its specific function.
5. The following sequence diagram illustrates how a general `Command` object interacts with other
   components of the system.
6. More details about specific commands will be covered in the Implementation section.

### Command: Subcomponent Sales

This section describes an overview of how the subcomponent `Sales` interacts with the sales related commands (`SellCommand`, `ReportCommand`, `MarkUpCommand`).
After the command input is parsed, depending on the `Command` type, different types of sales related command uses different sales API.

**API**:
1. [SalesManager.java](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/logic/command/sales/SalesManager.java)
2. [SalesReport.java](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/logic/command/sales/SalesReport.java)
3. [SalesMarkUp.java](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/logic/command/sales/SalesMarkUp.java)

![](diagrams/SalesSubComponentClassDiagram.svg)

The `Sales` subcomponent,
* When `Clivershelf` executes `SellCommand`, `SellCommand` calls the `SalesManager` to mark the item as sold.
* When `Clivershelf` executes `MarkUpCommand`, `MarkUpCommand` calls the `SalesMarkUp` to get markup information about the selected item. 
* When `Clivershelf` executes `ReportCommand`, `ReportCommand` calls the `SalesReport` to execute, and `SalesReport` will in turn 
  call `SalesManager` to get the list of sold items for further processing. 

For more specific details, refer to implementation of [`SellCommand`](#selling-an-item), [`ReportCommand`](#generating-sales-report), and [`MarkUpCommand`](#generating-item-markup-price). 

### Model component

The `Model` component is responsible for handling the basic item management instructions. This sections describes how the classes in model component are structure and how they interact with each other.

**API**:

1. [Item.java](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/model/Item.java)
    1. A `Item` object stores the information about a product in the bookstore:
    2. `name` of the product, consists of alphabet, number, whitespace, underscore and round bracket. e.g., Time
       Magazine.
    3. `purchaseCost`, the non-negative price the bookstore owner paid for the product.
    4. `sellingPrice`, the non-negative amount a buyer pays for the product.

<br />

2. [Shelf.java](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/model/Shelf.java)
    1. A `Shelf` object stores `Item` objects.
    2. All `Item` are stored in one and only one of the `Shelf` objects.
    3. A `Shelf` object can be instantiated using the constructor `new Shelf(name: String)`
       or `ShelfList.getShelfList().addShelf(name: String)`
    4. All `Shelf` objets are automatically recorded by `ShelfList` at instantiation.
    
<br />
    
3. [ShelfList.java](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/model/ShelfList.java)
    1. The `ShelfList` stores all the shelves' data i.e., all `Shelf` objects
    2. `ShelfList` is implemented using Singleton Pattern. The single instance can be obtained
       using `ShelfList.getShelfList()`

The Class Diagram below illustrates how the model components interacts with each other.

![](diagrams/Model_ClassDiagram.svg)

The Object Diagram below illustrates a sample state of the components.

![](diagrams/Model_ObjectDiagram.svg)

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates how `Shelf` and `ShelfList` interacts with each other when different `Shelf` instantiation
methods are used.

![](diagrams/Model_newShelf.svg)
![](diagrams/Model_addShelf.svg)

### Storage component

The storage component consists of `Storage` class. It handles the saving of user data by the command component and also
loading data on program start up.

The diagram below shows how `Storage` interacts with [`model`](#model-component) during `saveData()`.

![](diagrams/Storage_saveData.svg)

The diagram below shows how `Storage` interacts with [`model`](#model-component) during `loadData()`

![](diagrams/Storage_loadData.svg)

## Implementation

### Adding an item

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions of different subcomponents of the system when adding an item to the
shelf.

![](diagrams/Implementation_AddItems.svg)

The user can add new items to a shelf by specifying the number of items, item details and the name of shelf to add to.

1. As mentioned in the "Design" section, the `Parser` parses user input and returns the new `AddCommand` object to the
   `CliverShelf`.
2. The `CliverShelf` then invokes the `execute()` method of the `AddCommand` object.
3. The `AddCommand` object instantiates a new `item` object. It also invokes the `getShelf(shelfName: String)` method of
   the global `ShelfList` to get the specified `Shelf` object. Then, it calls the `addItem(newItem: Item)` method of
   the `Shelf` object to add the new `item` to this specific `Shelf`.
4. If the specified shelf does not exist, then the user cannot add new items. A new shelf should be first created
   using `CreateShelfCommand`.

#### Design considerations:

Aspect: How to set up the shelf to add to
* Alternative 1 (current choice): User needs to ensure that the shelf exists before adding new items, or the
  addition will not be successful. No automatic creation of shelves is allowed.
    * Pros: Better control of the shelves.
    * Cons: User needs to create a shelf first.

<br />

* Alternative 2: If the shelf does not exist, the shelf with the name specified by the user will be automatically
  added.
    * Pros: More convenient as creation of shelf is automatic.
    * Cons: Can result in accidental addition of shelves of unwanted names (if the user typed in wrongly).

### Editing an item

![](diagrams/Implementation_EditItems.svg)

The user can edit the property of an item in a shelf by specifying shelf name, item index, property to edit and new
value.

1. The `CliverShelf` invokes the `execute()` method of the `EditCommand` object.
2. The `EditCommand` object calls the `getShelf(shelfName: String)` method of the global `ShelfList` to get the
   specified shelf.
3. If the shelf exists, the `EditCommand` object will invoke the `getItem(index: int)` method to get the selected item
   to update from the shelf. Then, the `EditCommand` object will call the `setPurchaseCost(newValue: String)`
   or `setSellingPrice(newValue: String)` or `setRemarks(newValue: String)` of the `Item` object to set the purchase
   cost, selling price or remarks of the item.
4. If the specified shelf does not exist, the editing operation will fail.

#### Design considerations:

Aspect: How to change a certain property precisely
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Let the user specify which property to edit, and have setProperty methods for each
  property in the code.
    * Pros: Only need to change one property.
    * Cons: Need one additional step to check which property is selected by the user.

<br />

* Alternative 2: Let the user specify the new values for all properties just like adding a new item.
    * Pros: The user can change multiple properties at once using only one EditCommand.
    * Cons: Longer input is needed from the user even if he/she just wants to change one property.

### Listing all items

The diagram below shows the sequence diagram for ListCommand, which is responsible for listing the items in the shelves.

![](diagrams/Logic_ListCommandSequenceDiagram.svg)

A user can choose to either list out all the items in the bookstore (i.e. every shelf), or within a specific shelf.

* If user wishes to list out all items within a **specific** shelf:
    1. He keys in `list shlv/[SHELF_NAME]`
    2. This invokes `Parser#parseCommand()`, and since the command argument is `list`, it will further
       invoke `Parser#prepareList()`.
    3. It will then construct a command `ListCommand` using `ListCommand(shelf: String)`, returning it back
       to `CliverShelf`.
    4. Back in `CliverShelf`, `ListCommand#execute()` is invoked and since `ListCommand(shelf: String)` is constructed,
       condition for `toPrintAll` is set to `false` and not satisfied. This invokes `ListCommand#getOneList()`
    5. The string result output is then passed back to `CliverShelf`.

<br />

* If user wishes to list out all the items in the bookstore:
    1. He keys in: `list`.
    2. This invokes `Parser#parseCommand()`, and since the input is `list` it will further invoke `Parser#prepareList()`
       .
    3. It will then construct a command `ListCommand` using `ListCommand()`, returning it back to `CliverShelf`.
    4. Back in `CliverShelf`, `ListCommand#execute()` is invoked, and since `ListCommand()` is constructed, condition
       for `toPrintAll` is set to `true` and satisfied. This invokes `ListCommand#getEveryList()`
    5. The string result output is then passed back to `CliverShelf`.

The Class Diagram below illustrates how the components work together in `ListCommand`

![](diagrams/Logic_ListCommandClassDiagram.svg)

#### Design considerations:

Aspect: Indexes of items on the list are not in single sequential order (i.e 1, 2, 3...)
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Identical items are grouped together into a single entry, with their indexes being
  printed as a range. (e.g. First entry of 5 identical items on the list will be grouped as index "001-005", instead
  of "1")
    * Pros: User can use `delete` or `edit` on a single item, instead of the whole group of identical items
      together (e.g. If there are 5 identical items, but you only want to change 1 of them because perhaps they are
      damaged, and you want to add a remark)
    * Cons: Looks less user-friendly

<br />

* Alternative 2: The indexes of the list are printed in single sequential order.
    * Pros: Looks a lot neater as there is only 1 number instead of a range of numbers
    * Cons: User is unable to `delete` or `edit` a singular item.

### Selling an item

The sequence diagram below shows how the feature of selling an item (SellCommand) is implemented.

![](diagrams/Implementation_SellItems.svg)

1. When program invokes `SellCommand#execute()`, `SellCommand` object validates the itemID from user input by trying to 
   get the item from the `ShelfList` through `ShelfList#getItem(itemID)`.
2. Once it gets the item, `SellCommand` calls `SalesManager#sell()` to mark the item as sold.
   <br /> In `SalesManager#sell()`: 
   1. It will try to get the `originalShelf` where the item to be sold belongs to
   2. Then delete the sold item from the `originalShelf` by the shelf name
   3. The function will first prepare to store the details of the soldItem 
      * By calling `ShelfList#getShelf("soldItems")` to get the shelf called `soldItems` represented by `soldItemsShelf` 
         to store the records of all soldItems.
      * Also, details of Item to be sold will be constructed as a new `SoldItem` object, represented by `newSoldItem`
   4. The `newSoldItem` will then be added to the `soldItemsShelf` via `Shelf#addItem(newSoldItem)`.
3. Once the above steps are done, `SalesManager` will return a `finishedMessage`, which will then be passed back to 
   `CliverShelf` for printing.

#### Design considerations:

Aspect: How to determine the sale time

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use the system time when the user sold the item.
    * Pros: Does not need one additional parameter (sale time) from the user. Shorter command for the user.
    * Cons: Does not allow the user to manually set the sale time. Not very flexible for the user if he/she forgot
      to sell an item and wants to make up for it later on.

<br />

* Alternative 2: Requires the user to specify the sale time.
    * Pros: More flexibility for the user to add on sale records that he/she forgot to add.
    * Cons: Needs one additional parameter from the user. Longer command.

### Generating sales report

This section will describe how the feature generating a sales report (ReportCommand) is implemented.

![](diagrams/Implementation_GenerateReports.svg)

The simplified overview of report implementation is as follows: 

1. `CliverShelf` invokes `ReportCommand#execute()`
2. A `SalesReport` object which is named `newSalesReport` is created
3. If the type specified in user input is `stats`, `SalesReport#generateSoldItemStats()` is called to get a string of
   sold item statistics represented by `statsReport` in the diagram.
4. Else, `SalesReport#generateSoldItemDetails()` will be called to get the filtered SoldItem list in the form of a string 
   before returning the String to `CliverShelf` for printing.

The below diagram shows a more in-depth implementation of report feature. 

![](diagrams/Implementation_SalesReport_Stats.svg)
![](diagrams/Implementation_SalesReport_Details.svg)

The more detailed inner workings of the report implementation is as follows:

* Case 1: user specifies `stats` for type.
  1. `ReportCommand#generateSoldItemStats()` is executed.
  2. `SalesManager#filterSoldItems(timeSpan)` is called.
  3. `SalesManager` will call `ShelfList#getShelf("soldItems")`, which returns a `soldItemShelf`.
  4. `SalesManager` filters the items from `soldItemShelf` according to the `timeSpan`, 
     & returns the list named `filteredSoldItems` which represents the list of `soldItems` named from that `timeSpan`.
  5. `SalesReport` will then self invoke `SalesReport#getSalesStatisticsString(filteredSoltItems)` to calculate the 
     relevant statistical information needed, and returns a formatted string `salesStats`.
  6. `SalesReport` will return `salesStats` to `ReportCommand`.
  
<br />

* Case 2: user specifies `items` for type
  1. `ReportCommand#generateSoldItemDetails()` is executed.
  2. Same as step 2 of case 1
  3. Same as step 3 of case 1
  4. Same as step 4 of case 1
  5. `SalesReport` will then self invoke `SalesReport#getSoldItemsDetailsString(filteredSoldItems)` to 
     get the formatted string `soldItemDetails` containing information about `SoldItem` details from `filteredSoldItems`.
  6. `SalesReport` will return `soldItemDetails` to `ReportCommand`.

#### Design considerations:

Aspect how to show the report `stats` or `items` within a time period

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Convert `YEAR-MONTH` input string to `YearMonth` object to check valid year and month 
  * Pros: Able to use pre-written `YearMonth` class methods, to simplify verification of year & month input 
    And also simple check if the `YearMonth` input is in correct order
  * Cons: Have to implement valid year restriction since, the max year accepted is a very large integer.

<br />

* Alternative 2: check the and the input manually by extracting the year and the month from the string, 
  then converting to integer for validity checking
    * Pros: Able to have flexibility in terms of more restrictions for valid year e.g. starting from year 1970
    * Cons: More lines of code due to more factors to consider for checking if the year and month are valid
      This makes code messier, increases debugging efforts & number of unit test cases. 

### Generating item markup price

This section will illustrate how the marking up of an item price (MarkUpCommand) is being implemented.

![](diagrams/MarkUpCommandSequenceDiagram.svg)

A user may choose to check the estimated marked up price of an item, given a specific mark up percentage.

1. After user input is parsed, a `MarkUpCommand` object is constructed & returned to `Clivershelf`.
2. `CliverShelf` invokes `MarkUpCommand#execute()`
   1. A `SalesMarkUp` Object is constructed,
   2. Then `SalesMarkUp#getItemToMarkUpInfo()` is called
   3. followed by `SalesMarkUp#getSelectedItemMarkUpInfo()` to get the relevant information about the selected item
       1. If `userRequestPercent` not specified in input, `MarkUpCommand#execute()` calls `SalesMarkUp#getEstimatedMarkUpInfo()` 
          which get the markup in percentage intervals of 20, returned as a string
       2. Else, `SalesMarkUp#getUserRequestMarkUpInfo()` is called to get the requested user percentage mark up
          information, returned as a string
   4. All the strings received from calling functions in `SalesMarkUp`, will be appended and returned to `Clivershelf`
      as a `resultString` for printing.

#### Design considerations:

Aspect: How markup executes:

* Alternative 1 (current choice): `SalesMarkup` is a separate class from `SalesManager`.
    * Pros: Increases cohesiveness. Easier testing efforts.
    * Cons: More code written.

<br />

* Alternate 2: `SalesMarkUp` functions can be integrated with `SalesManager` class. However, having more methods in the same
  class
    * Pros: All methods in the same class, lesser additional code.
    * Cons: Reduces cohesiveness. Increases testing efforts as more methods in the same class to be tested which could
      be more complicated.
