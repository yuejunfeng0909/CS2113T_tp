## Project: CLIverShelf

CLIverShelf is a desktop application used for inventory management and quick data analysis tool for small businesses
such as small bookstore and convenient stores. The user interacts with it using a Command-Line Interface. It is written
in Java, and has about 6kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Data structure**: Constructed the data structure model (Pull
  requests [#24](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/24) and
  [#60](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/60))
    * What it does: The model classes provides all the necessary methods that are required to implement all
      functionalities in this application.
* **New Feature**: Local data storage (Pull request [#89](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/89))
    * What it does: Automatically saves all changes to a local JSON file after the execution of any command. It also
      manages the loading of data from the same JSON file to the application when the application is opened.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user no longer need to keep the
      application on forever to keep the application remember all the information. The user can also easily keep a
      snapshot of the data as backup at any time and no longer worry about any significant data loss.
    * Highlights: This enhancement does not affect any existing functionalities.
    * Credits: [org.json](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json) APIs were used to create JSON file and parse
      JSON files.
* **New Feature**: User-friendly UI (Pull requests [#59](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/59),
  [#94](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/94) and
  [#188](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/188))
    * What it does: Format output from the application to make the application more user-friendly by enclosing the
      messages from the application into a message bubbles.
    * Justification: This application often display a lot of information to the user. Without deliberately separating
      user inputs and application outputs, the user may get lost if they want to look through previous command outputs.
* **New Feature**: Core features for `SalesManager` (Pull
  request [#61](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/61))
    * What it does: Allow the user to mark an item as sold and record it into the system for future analysis.
    * Justification: This features is one of the core features of this application. This allows the user to record sales
      of inventory and subsequently generating sales reports to help the user better understand the business' status and
      make more informed business decisions.
* **New Feature**: Search function (Pull request [#210](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-4/tp/pull/210))
    * What it does: Display all items that are related to the search keyword.
    * Justification: This feature made it easier for the users to manage items. The user may want to know if an item is
      still in stock, they will be able to know how much inventory they have left by searching for the item name. The
      user can also easily find out all the items that have the same remark. For example, the user may want to know all
      the items that contains the same remarks such as "damaged" or "limited edition" and use the information to make
      better business decisions.
